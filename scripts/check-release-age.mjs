/**
 * Dependency-cooldown gate. Fails a PR that introduces a package version younger
 * than RELEASE_AGE_MIN_DAYS (default 7). This is a second layer on top of
 * Dependabot's own `cooldown`: that window is advisory at PR-creation time and
 * has documented reliability gaps for the npm ecosystem
 * (https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/12677) — several
 * same-day patch walks can slip through while each release is only days old,
 * well inside the configured 7-day cooldown. This gate enforces the same policy
 * deterministically, at the layer we control (CI), so a hot version cannot land
 * even when Dependabot's cooldown is bypassed.
 *
 * Why this shape and not pnpm's `minimum-release-age`: putting that setting in
 * committed pnpm config makes Dependabot's own lockfile regeneration honor it,
 * which forces pnpm to fetch publish-time metadata for the whole candidate tree
 * on every update — the full-metadata storm that causes multi-minute/hour
 * Dependabot timeouts on large repos. This gate never touches Dependabot's
 * resolver: it inspects the *result* (the lockfile diff) and queries the
 * registry for only the handful of newly-introduced versions. Diffing the
 * lockfile (not just package.json) also catches fresh *transitive* bumps.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-release-age.mjs [baseRef]
 *   baseRef  git ref to diff against (default: origin/main). The base
 *            pnpm-lock.yaml is read via `git show <baseRef>:pnpm-lock.yaml`;
 *            the head lockfile is read from ./pnpm-lock.yaml in the working
 *            tree. Only versions present in head but not base are checked.
 *
 * Exits 0 if every newly-introduced version is at least the threshold old (or
 * could not be resolved on the public registry — private/workspace/tarball
 * specifiers are skipped). Exits 1 listing each too-young version. Registry
 * fetch failures are warned and skipped (fail-open) so a flaky registry does
 * not produce a spurious red build; a confirmed too-young version always fails.
